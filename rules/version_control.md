# Version Control Best Practices

## 1. Git Best Practices
### Branching Strategy
- **Main (`main`)**: Used for production-ready, stable code.
- **Development (`develop`)**: Integration branch for testing new features.
- **Feature Branches (`feature/{name}`)**: Created from `develop` for implementing new features.
- **Bugfix Branches (`bugfix/{name}`)**: Created from `develop` or `release/{version}` to address specific issues.
- **Release Branches (`release/{version}`)**: Prepares for new production releases; allows final bug fixes and polishing before merging into `main`.
- **Hotfix Branches (`hotfix/{version}`)**: Created from `main` to address critical production issues.

### Commit Guidelines
- Follow a structured commit message format:
  ```plaintext
  type(scope): description
  ```
  - **Type** (feat, fix, chore, docs, style, refactor, test, perf, build, ci, revert)
  - **Scope** (optional, specifies affected module or component)
  - **Description** (concise summary of changes)
  
  **Example:**
  ```plaintext
  feat(auth): add JWT authentication support
  fix(ui): resolve navbar alignment issue on mobile
  ```

- Use imperative, present tense (e.g., "Add feature" instead of "Added feature").
- Keep messages under 50 characters for the title; provide details in the body if necessary.

### Pull Request (PR) Workflow
1. Create a new branch based on `develop`.
2. Implement changes and commit following guidelines.
3. Push the branch to the remote repository.
4. Open a PR targeting `develop` or `main` (depending on context).
5. Request reviews and make necessary revisions.
6. Ensure all CI/CD tests pass before merging.
7. Merge using **Squash and Merge** or **Rebase and Merge** (avoid direct merges).

### Code Review Process
- Use PR templates to maintain consistency.
- Request at least one reviewer before merging.
- Follow the "Review, Approve, Merge" cycle:
  1. Review code quality, structure, and adherence to conventions.
  2. Suggest improvements or request necessary changes.
  3. Approve once all issues are resolved.
  4. Merge following PR workflow guidelines.

## 2. Git Workflow Conventions
### Best Practices for Repository Management
- Keep repository clean: remove unnecessary files and dependencies.
- Use `.gitignore` to exclude generated files, logs, and environment configurations.
- Maintain a `README.md` with installation, usage, and contribution guidelines.
- Create and update a `CHANGELOG.md` to document notable changes.

### Handling Merge Conflicts
- Always pull the latest changes before pushing commits.
- Resolve conflicts locally before committing.
- Use `git rebase` when integrating changes into feature branches for a cleaner history.
- If conflicts persist, use `git mergetool` for better resolution.

### Tagging and Versioning
- Use semantic versioning (`MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`) for tagging releases.
  ```plaintext
  git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "Initial stable release"
  git push origin v1.0.0
  ```
- Use `git describe --tags` to retrieve the latest version.

## 3. Continuous Integration & Deployment (CI/CD)
- Use CI/CD pipelines to automate:
  - Code linting and static analysis
  - Running unit and integration tests
  - Building and packaging releases
- Implement rollback strategies for deployment failures.
- Monitor production deployments and set up alerts for errors.

By following these best practices, development teams can maintain a structured, efficient, and scalable version control workflow.
