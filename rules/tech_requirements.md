# Technical Requirements Guide

## 1. Introduction
Defining technical requirements is essential for ensuring system reliability, performance, and scalability. This guide provides a structured approach to documenting technical needs.

## 2. System Constraints
### Performance Requirements
- API response time should be **< 200ms** for 95% of requests.
- System should handle **1,000 requests per second** under normal load.
- Concurrency support for **10,000 simultaneous users**.

### Availability Requirements
- Uptime target of **99.9%**.
- Maximum **5-minute recovery time** (RTO) for critical failures.
- Data replication for **zero data loss** (RPO = 0).

### Resource Limitations
- Development environment:
  - **CPU:** Min Quad-core
  - **RAM:** Min 16GB
  - **Storage:** Min 500GB SSD
- Production environment:
  - **Cloud-based infrastructure (AWS, GCP, or Azure)**
  - **Auto-scaling enabled** for traffic spikes.

## 3. Functional Requirements
- **User Authentication**: JWT-based authentication with OAuth2 support.
- **Data Processing**: Batch and real-time data processing capabilities.
- **API Design**: RESTful APIs with OpenAPI documentation.
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation with logging and monitoring.

## 4. Security Requirements
- **Authentication & Authorization**:
  - Role-based access control (RBAC).
  - Multi-factor authentication (MFA).
- **Data Security**:
  - End-to-end encryption (AES-256 for storage, TLS 1.3 for transport).
  - Regular security audits and compliance checks (GDPR, HIPAA).
- **Vulnerability Management**:
  - Automated dependency scanning and patching.

## 5. Integration Requirements
- **Third-Party APIs**: Stripe for payments, SendGrid for emails.
- **Data Formats**: JSON for API responses, CSV/XML for bulk data import/export.
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Kafka for asynchronous messaging.

## 6. Scalability Requirements
- **Database Scaling**:
  - Read replicas for high availability.
  - Sharding for large datasets.
- **Application Scaling**:
  - Containerized microservices (Docker, Kubernetes).
  - Load balancers for request distribution.

## 7. Monitoring & Logging
- **System Monitoring**: Prometheus + Grafana for real-time metrics.
- **Error Tracking**: Sentry for exception tracking.
- **Log Management**: Centralized logging using ELK stack.

## 8. Best Practices
- **Ensure requirements are measurable and testable.**
- **Use automation for deployment and monitoring.**
- **Document and version control all configurations.**

Following these guidelines ensures a robust, scalable, and secure system architecture.
