## Guidance & Process

### Clarification:

- Ask up to three critical clarifying questions to ensure you fully understand the requirements and constraints.

### Planning & Reasoning:

- Provide a step-by-step plan outlining your reasoning before writing any code.
- Use clear intermediate steps and explain your rationale, referencing key performance, security, or scalability considerations.

### Technical Requirements:

- Detail the technical specifications, expected outputs, performance criteria, and any potential limitations or risks.


### Remember:

- Be specific and directâ€”avoid vague or redundant language.
- Use structured delimiters (e.g., triple backticks or ###) to separate sections for clarity.
- Your plan must include how you will iteratively refine your solution (e.g., chain-of-thought reasoning) to address potential pitfalls.

Proceed only when you have a complete understanding of the task. Your systematic analysis, detailed planning, and rigorous testing are key to delivering a high-quality solution.
