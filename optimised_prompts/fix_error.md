```
<error>
[Clearly describe the error message, affected functionality, and any relevant logs.]
</error>
```

```

## Guidance & Process

### Clarification:

- Ask up to three critical clarifying questions to ensure you fully understand the error and its root cause.

### Root Cause Analysis:

- Provide a step-by-step analysis of how the issue manifests and what components are affected.
- Identify the exact failure point and its underlying cause.

### Resolution Strategy:

- Describe your approach to fixing the issue, ensuring that the resolution is robust, secure, and efficient.
- Explain how you will prevent similar issues in the future (e.g., additional logging, monitoring, or validation mechanisms).

### Testing & Validation:

- Detail the tests you will implement to confirm the fix, including unit tests, integration tests, and regression tests.
- Verify that no new issues are introduced as a result of the fix.

### Remember:

- Be specific and directâ€”avoid vague or redundant language.
- Use structured delimiters (e.g., triple backticks or ###) to separate sections for clarity.
- Your resolution plan must include how you will iteratively refine the fix to ensure stability.

Proceed only when you have a complete understanding of the issue. Your systematic analysis, detailed planning, and rigorous testing are key to delivering a high-quality resolution.
