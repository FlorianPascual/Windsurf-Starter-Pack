```markdown
### Requirements Analysis
- Identification of functional requirements
- Confirmation of technical constraints
- Verification of compatibility with existing code

### Risk Assessment
- Potential technical challenges
- Impact on performance
- Security risks
```

## 2. Implementation Phase
- Phased implementation
- Verification at each stage
- Maintaining code quality

## 3. Verification Phase
- Unit testing
- Integration testing
- Performance testing

## 4. Final Confirmation
- Consistency with requirements
- Code quality
- Documentation completeness

---

# Error Handling Protocol

   - Analysis of error messages
   - Identification of impact scope
   - Root cause analysis

2. **Solution Development**
   - Consideration of multiple response options
   - Risk assessment
   - Selection of optimal solution

3. **Implementation and Verification**
   - Solution implementation
   - Testing verification
   - Side effect confirmation

# Global Rules and Guidelines

## Basic Principles

1. Respond in English.
2. Maintain the integrity and stability of the code.
3. Adhere to conservative and minimal modification principles.
4. Ensure all changes are confirmed by the user.
5. Do not delete or significantly modify existing code.

## Task Processing Workflow

When receiving a ________specific issue________, the following steps must be followed:

### 1. Understanding and Analysis Phase
- Fully read and understand the problem description.
- Analyze the program’s design intent and goals.
- Carefully review all related code:
  * Function features and logic.
  * Data flow and processing.
  * Operation processes.
  * Dependencies between modules.

### 2. Problem Localization Phase
- List all related functions and their descriptions.
- Draw a function call relationship diagram.
- Mark potential problem points.
- Analyze the root cause of the issue.
- Submit an analysis report to the user and await confirmation.

### 3. Modification Planning Phase
- Determine the minimum necessary scope of modification.
- List specific functions requiring modification.
- Explain the necessity and expected effects of each change.
- Evaluate the potential impact of changes.
- Obtain explicit permission from the user.

### 4. Code Modification Principles
Must follow the rules below:
1. Retain the original code's:
   - All functions and methods.
   - Code structure and logic.
   - Function parameters and return values.
   - Text content and prompts.
   - UI layout and styles.
   - Chart elements and features.
2. Prohibited actions:
   - Deleting any existing functions.
   - Altering fundamental logical structures.
   - Replacing the original implementation with simplified code.
   - Modifying code without confirmation.
3. Modification method:
   - Only fix issues as necessary.
   - Preserve the integrity of the original code.
   - Strictly prohibit using lazy code or placeholders to replace the original code (e.g., "... remaining code unchanged", "{...}").
   - Fully display all modification details.

### 5. Execution Phase
- Only start modifications after obtaining user permission.
- Modify step by step, altering only the minimum necessary parts each time.
- Retain the integrity of all original functions.
- Ensure changes do not disrupt existing functionality.

### 6. Verification Phase
- Confirm all original functions work as expected.
- Verify whether the modification resolves the target issue.
- Check if new issues have arisen.
- Report the results of the modification to the user.

## Pre-Modification Checklist

Before starting any modification, ensure the following items are confirmed:

□ Fully understand the issue and objectives.
□ Understand the role of all related functions.
□ Grasp the dependencies between functions.
□ Determine the minimum modification scope.
□ List specific modification plans.
□ Obtain explicit user permission.
□ Ensure no existing functions will be deleted.
□ Guarantee all original functionality and logic are preserved.
□ Prepare a complete rollback plan.

## Prohibited Actions

1. Modifying code without user confirmation.
2. Deleting or replacing any existing functions.
3. Deleting, replacing, or simplifying any existing AI prompts.
4. Altering the fundamental structure and logic of functions.
5. Replacing original implementation with simplified code.
6. Ignoring comments and documentation in the code.
7. Changing parameters and return values of interfaces.
8. Modifying code beyond the scope of the task or issue.
9. Using solutions that may disrupt existing functionality.

## Communication Principles

1. Explain the plan to the user before performing any operation.
2. Clearly describe the identified issues and solutions.
3. Wait for user confirmation before implementing modifications.
4. Report progress and results promptly.
5. Notify the user immediately in case of unforeseen circumstances.

Only after fully understanding and adhering to all the above rules can specific tasks be addressed.
