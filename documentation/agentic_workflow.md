An agentic workflow is a a software engineering workflow with IDE-integrated LLMs and external validation LLMs.
It helps LLM agents to follow a defined software engineering workflow in order to get better at designing, automating and developping an application.
The workflow is composed of several markdown files that are given to the agents to help them know exactly what to do.

Here is an example of a very good workflow that you can memorized and reuse.
This workflow is composed of the following files :

1 - tech_requirements.md
2 - dir_setup.md
3 - general_workflow.md
4 - project_init_guide.md
5 - readme_generation.md
6 - vcs_llm_workflow.md

Here are below the content of all those files :

[Your prose description]

Generate:
1. Project Overview
2. Technical Requirements
3. System Architecture
4. Core Features List
5. Non-functional Requirements
6. Integration Points
7. Success Criteria

Format the output as a structured markdown document with clear sections and subsections.
```

### Step 2: Feature Breakdown
Use the same LLM to break down features:

```markdown
Based on this project specification:
[Paste project spec]

Please break this down into individual feature contracts. For each feature:
1. Input/Output Contracts
2. Dependencies
3. Integration Points
4. Success Criteria
5. Validation Steps

Format each feature as a separate markdown document.
```

## Phase 2: Feature Implementation Loop üîÑ

### Step 1: Contract Generation
For each feature, use this prompt:

```markdown
Create a detailed technical contract for this feature:
[Paste feature description]

Generate:
1. Interface Definition
   - Input parameters
   - Output format
   - Error states
2. Validation Rules
   - Input constraints
   - Business rules
   - Edge cases
3. Test Scenarios
   - Happy path
   - Error cases
   - Edge cases
```

### Step 2: Implementation Workflow

#### A. Initial Implementation (IDE-integrated LLM)
```markdown
Implement the following contract:
[Paste contract]

Requirements:
1. Follow the exact interface specification
2. Implement input validation first
3. Add error handling as specified
4. Include inline documentation
5. Add type hints/annotations

Current codebase context:
[Relevant code snippets]
```

#### B. Validation Loop
For each implementation:

1. **Contract Compliance Check**
```markdown
Verify this implementation against the contract:
[Paste implementation]

Contract:
[Paste contract]

Check:
1. Interface compliance
2. Input validation
3. Error handling
4. Type safety
```

2. **Iteration Prompt (if needed)**
```markdown
The implementation violates these contract points:
[List violations]

Please modify only the affected components while maintaining:
1. Existing working functionality
2. Interface compliance
3. Error handling patterns
```

## Phase 3: Integration üîó

### Step 1: Integration Contract
```markdown
Create an integration contract for:
Feature: [Feature name]
Existing Systems: [List systems]

Generate:
1. Integration points
2. Data flow
3. Error handling
4. Rollback procedures
```

### Step 2: Integration Implementation
```markdown
Implement the integration according to this contract:
[Paste integration contract]

Existing integration points:
[Paste relevant code]

Requirements:
1. Maintain existing interfaces
2. Add error handling
3. Include rollback logic
```

## Workflow Management Template üìã

### 1. Project Documentation Structure
```markdown

2. Immediate dependencies
3. Relevant error states

ROTATE AS NEEDED:
1. Implementation details
2. Test cases
3. Integration points
```

2. **Context Rotation Strategy**
- Keep contracts in separate files
- Reference by link/name
- Include only relevant sections

## Example Workflow

1. **Start with prose requirement:**
   ```
   "We need a user authentication system with JWT"
   ```

2. **Generate project spec** (Using Claude):
   ```markdown
   Please create a project specification for:
   [Paste requirement]
   ```

3. **Generate feature contracts** (Using Claude):
   ```markdown
   Based on this project spec:
   [Paste spec]
   Generate individual feature contracts
   ```

4. **Implementation loop** (IDE LLM):
   ```markdown
   Contract: [Paste current feature contract]
   Task: Implement the login endpoint
   Context: Express.js API
   ```

5. **Validation** (Claude):
   ```markdown
   Verify this implementation:
   [Paste code]
   Against this contract:
   [Paste contract]
   ```

## Key Success Factors üéØ

1. **Contract Clarity**
   - Explicit interfaces
   - Clear validation rules
   - Defined error states

2. **Context Management**
   - Rotate context efficiently
   - Keep contracts separate
   - Reference only needed parts

3. **LLM Selection**
   - Use powerful LLMs for planning
   - Use IDE LLMs for implementation
   - Use powerful LLMs for validation

4. **Documentation Structure**
   - Maintain clear hierarchy
   - Keep contracts accessible
   - Track validations

# Version Control Integration in LLM Development Workflow

## Git Strategy üîÑ

### 1. Commit Structure

#### Atomic Commits
- One logical change per commit
- Tied to contract validation points
- Clear, traceable history

#### When to Commit

1. **Contract Implementation Milestones**
   - Initial interface implementation
   - Input validation complete
   - Error handling added
   - Tests implemented
   - Contract fully satisfied

2. **Integration Points**
   - Dependencies integrated
   - API endpoints connected
   - Database schemas updated

### 2. Commit Message Template

```markdown
<type>(<scope>): <summary>

<body>

Contract: <contract-reference>
Validation: <validation-status>
Breaking Changes: <yes/no>

Related Issues: <issue-references>
```

Where:
- `type`: feat|fix|docs|style|refactor|test|chore
- `scope`: feature-name|module|component
- `summary`: imperative mood, no period
- `body`: detailed changes
- `contract-reference`: link/reference to relevant contract
- `validation-status`: passed|partial|pending

### 3. LLM Git Integration

#### IDE LLM Should:
‚úÖ **Suggest commit points**
```markdown
Recommendation: Changes ready for commit
- Interface implementation complete
- Input validation added
- Tests passing
```

‚úÖ **Generate commit messages**
```markdown
Suggested commit message:
feat(auth): implement JWT validation middleware

- Add token verification
- Implement expiry checking
- Add role validation

Contract: auth/jwt-validation.md
Validation: passed
Breaking Changes: no
```

‚ùå **Should NOT:**
- Execute git commands
- Push changes
- Merge branches
- Modify git history

### 4. Developer Responsibilities

1. **Review Changes**
   - Verify contract compliance
   - Check for unintended modifications
   - Validate test coverage

2. **Execute Git Commands**
   - Commit changes manually
   - Push to remote
   - Manage branches
   - Handle merges

### 5. Git Workflow Integration

```markdown
Feature Development Loop:

1. Create feature branch
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feat/auth-jwt
   ```

2. Implementation Cycles:
   - LLM implements contract point
   - Developer reviews changes
   - LLM suggests commit message
   - Developer commits:
     ```bash
     git add .
     git commit -m "feat(auth): implement JWT validation"
     ```

3. Push Changes:
   - Developer reviews branch
   - Developer pushes:
     ```bash
     git push origin feat/auth-jwt
     ```


### 6. Version Control Best Practices

#### Branch Strategy
```markdown
main
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ develop
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ feature/auth-jwt
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ feature/user-profile
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ fix/login-validation
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ release/v1.0
```

#### Commit Guidelines
1. **Frequency**
   - Commit after each contract validation point
   - Keep changes atomic and focused
   - Include relevant tests

2. **Message Quality**
   ```markdown
   ‚úÖ Good:
   feat(auth): implement JWT validation middleware
   
   - Add token verification with RS256
   - Implement 15min token expiry
   - Add role-based validation
   
   Contract: auth/jwt-validation.md
   Validation: passed

   ‚ùå Bad:
   updated auth code
   ```

3. **Contract Traceability**
   - Reference contract in commit message
   - Link to validation results
   - Note any deviations

### 7. Integration with Workflow

```markdown
Implementation Phase:
1. Create feature branch
2. [LLM] Implement contract point
3. [Developer] Review changes
4. [LLM] Suggest commit message
5. [Developer] Commit changes
6. Repeat until contract satisfied
7. [Developer] Push changes
8. Create PR

Validation Phase:
1. [LLM] Review PR changes
2. [Developer] Address feedback
3. [Developer] Merge PR
```

### 8. Example Workflow

```markdown
1. Start Feature:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feat/auth-jwt
   ```

2. LLM Implementation:
   "I've implemented the JWT validation middleware according to contract."

3. LLM Commit Suggestion:
   ```markdown
   Suggested commit:
   feat(auth): implement JWT validation

   - Add middleware setup
   - Implement token verification
   - Add error handling

   Contract: auth/jwt-validation.md
   Validation: passed
   ```

4. Developer Review & Commit:
   ```bash
   git add src/middleware/auth.js
   git add tests/middleware/auth.test.js
   git commit -m "..."
   ```

5. Continue Development Loop

6. Final Push:
   ```bash
   git push origin feat/auth-jwt
   ```


### 9. Version Control Tips

1. **Keep Contract References**
   - Link contracts in commits
   - Track validation status
   - Document deviations

2. **Maintain Clean History**
   - Use meaningful commit messages
   - Keep changes atomic
   - Reference issues/tickets

3. **Review Before Commit**
   - Check for unintended changes
   - Verify contract compliance
   - Ensure test coverage

4. **Push Strategy**
   - Push when feature milestone complete
   - Push after significant changes
   - Push before end of day

Remember: Version control is the developer's responsibility. While LLMs can suggest commit points and messages, all git operations should be manually reviewed and executed by the developer to maintain code quality and history integrity.
